Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to complete **Challenge 1: Run EC2 and Install the Nginx Server**:

---

### **Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance**
1. **Log in to AWS Console**:
   - Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - Sign in with your credentials.

2. **Launch EC2 Instance**:
   - Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
   - Click **Launch Instance**.
   - Choose an **Amazon Linux** or **Ubuntu** AMI (e.g., Amazon Linux 2023 or Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS).
   - Select the instance type (e.g., `t2.micro`, which is free tier eligible).
   - Configure instance details (leave defaults if unsure).
   - Add storage (default is usually sufficient).

3. **Configure Security Group**:
   - Create a new security group or use an existing one.
   - Add the following rules:
     - **SSH (Port 22)**: Allow access from your IP or `0.0.0.0/0` (for any IP, but this is less secure).
     - **HTTP (Port 80)**: Allow access from `0.0.0.0/0` (for web traffic).

4. **Create/Download Key Pair**:
   - Create a new key pair (e.g., `nginx-key.pem`) and download it.
   - Save the key pair securely; youâ€™ll need it to SSH into the instance.

5. **Launch the Instance**:
   - Review your settings and click **Launch Instance**.

---

### **Step 2: SSH into the Instance and Install Nginx**
1. **Connect to the Instance**:
   - Open your terminal (Linux/Mac) or use an SSH client like PuTTY (Windows).
   - Navigate to the folder where your key pair is stored.
   - Run the following command to SSH into the instance:
     ```bash
     ssh -i /path/to/nginx-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
     ```
     - Replace `/path/to/nginx-key.pem` with the path to your key pair.
     - Replace `<public-ip>` with the public IP of your EC2 instance.
     - For Ubuntu, use `ubuntu` instead of `ec2-user`.

2. **Update the System**:
   - Run the following commands to update the package manager:
     ```bash
     sudo yum update -y  # For Amazon Linux
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y  # For Ubuntu
     ```

3. **Install Nginx**:
   - For Amazon Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y
     ```
   - For Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install nginx -y
     ```

---

### **Step 3: Start the Web Server and Enable It on Startup**
1. **Start Nginx**:
   - Run the following command to start the Nginx server:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start nginx
     ```

2. **Enable Nginx on Startup**:
   - Run the following command to ensure Nginx starts automatically on system boot:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable nginx
     ```

3. **Check Nginx Status**:
   - Verify that Nginx is running:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status nginx
     ```

---

### **Step 4: Modify Security Group to Allow HTTP Traffic**
1. **Go to EC2 Dashboard**:
   - In the AWS Console, navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
   - Select **Instances** and click on your running instance.

2. **Edit Security Group**:
   - Under the **Security** tab, click on the security group linked to your instance.
   - Click **Edit Inbound Rules**.
   - Add a new rule:
     - **Type**: HTTP
     - **Port Range**: 80
     - **Source**: `0.0.0.0/0` (or restrict to specific IPs for security).

3. **Save the Rules**.

---

### **Step 5: Access Your EC2 Public IP in a Browser**
1. **Get the Public IP**:
   - Go to the EC2 Dashboard and note the public IP of your instance.

2. **Open the Browser**:
   - Enter the public IP in your browserâ€™s address bar (e.g., `http://<public-ip>`).
   - You should see the **Nginx Welcome Page**.

---

### **Step 6: (Optional) Add Another EC2 Instance and Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
1. **Launch a Second EC2 Instance**:
   - Repeat Steps 1â€“5 to launch another EC2 instance in a different availability zone.

2. **Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
   - Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** and select **Load Balancers**.
   - Click **Create Load Balancer** and choose **Application Load Balancer**.
   - Configure the ALB:
     - Add both EC2 instances as targets.
     - Configure listeners for HTTP (Port 80).
   - Complete the setup and note the ALBâ€™s DNS name.

3. **Test the ALB**:
   - Open the ALBâ€™s DNS name in your browser.
   - Verify that the Nginx welcome page loads.

---

### **Step 7: Share a Screenshot**
1. Take a screenshot of the Nginx welcome page or the ALB working.
2. Share it on **LinkedIn** or **GitHub** with a description of your accomplishment!

---

### **Example Commands for Reference**
- SSH into EC2:
  ```bash
  ssh -i /path/to/nginx-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
  ```
- Install Nginx (Amazon Linux):
  ```bash
  sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y
  ```
- Start and Enable Nginx:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start nginx
  sudo systemctl enable nginx
  ```
