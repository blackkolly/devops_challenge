ðŸ”¥ Challenges
ðŸ”¹ Challenge 1: Use a matrix to test across:

3 versions of Node.js or Python

2 OSs (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest)

ðŸ”¹ Challenge 2: Use needs: to create a pipeline like:

build â†’ test â†’ deploy (conditionally run deploy if tests pass)

ðŸ”¹ Challenge 3: Use actions/cache@v3 to store build dependencies and speed up CI

ðŸ”¹ Challenge 4: Add workflow_dispatch inputs like environment: [dev, prod] and print them in the job

ðŸ”¹ Challenge 5: Add an if: condition to only run a deployment job on the main branch

ðŸ”¹ Challenge 6: Upload a build artifact in one job and download it in another

ðŸ”¹ Challenge 7: Create a reusable workflow called from another workflow using workflow_call

ðŸ”¹ Challenge 8: Define a protected environment with manual approval and use it in a deploy job

ðŸ”¹ Challenge 9: Use output from one job (e.g., version, build_hash) in the next job

ðŸ”¹ Challenge 10: Use a GitHub Action to build a Docker image, tag it, and push to Docker Hub

        Explanation:

    Matrix Testing (Challenge 1):

        Tests across 3 Node.js versions (14.x, 16.x, 18.x) and 3 Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10)

        Runs on both Ubuntu and Windows (with some exclusions to demonstrate matrix control)

    Job Dependencies with needs (Challenge 2):

        Pipeline flows: build â†’ test â†’ deploy

        Each job only runs if the previous one succeeds

    Caching Dependencies (Challenge 3):

        Uses actions/cache@v3 to cache Node.js modules and Python cache

        Cache key based on lock files for proper invalidation

    Workflow Dispatch Inputs (Challenge 4):

        Adds a dropdown input for environment (dev/prod)

        Prints the selected environment in the deploy job

    Conditional Deployment (Challenge 5):

        Deploy job only runs on main branch (github.ref == 'refs/heads/main')

        Also checks that tests passed (needs.test.result == 'success')
